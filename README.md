## 🌷 About Me

I enjoy turning ideas (even the silly ones!) into code and projects, because every experiment is a step towards growth.  
My motto: _"I create things that might be a bit useless, but they're always useful for learning!"_  
I'm passionate about technology, creativity, and making every day a chance to improve.
